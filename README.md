# Hello-World

Hello Coding World,

  I am Marcus. I am excited to be moving forward with my code after months of hard work and stumbling around on my own clueless. Now I am a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed coder that loves to code Javascript, React and soon Python.
  Coffee, cats and cold rainy days are the best of ways to code as far as I am concerned. Looking forward to showing the world what I've got in store for it. A side note, I am also getting married soon and will be moving out of the U.S.A.. I have spent my whole life with computers and remember the first time I tooled around inside an old PC of my Dad's. Of course it was not as modern with it's 1990's DOS and dial-up. But, to me it was a marvel and just a different kind of code to be played with. Love for the peeps and keep up the spectacular work.
  
  M White, not the shamma lamma lawn.
